A basic Android studio project for learning the basics of XML and how android studio work. There is nothing to understand about this project. if you open you will see a picture above and 100 words of "lorem" underneath. I added a TextEdit field where the user can input the name and a button to submit it, though there isn't any function to submit anything. Just a basic XML GUI.
